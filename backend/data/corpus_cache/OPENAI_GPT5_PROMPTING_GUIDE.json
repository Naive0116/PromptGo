  "content": "# GPT-5 Prompting Guide\n\nGPT-5, our newest flagship model, represents a substantial leap forward in agentic task performance, coding, raw intelligence, and steerability.\n\n## Agentic Workflow Predictability\n\nWe trained GPT-5 with developers in mind: we've focused on improving tool calling, instruction following, and long-context understanding to serve as the best foundation model for agentic applications.\n\n### Controlling Agentic Eagerness\n\nAgentic scaffolds can span a wide spectrum of control—some systems delegate the vast majority of decision-making to the underlying model, while others keep the model on a tight leash with heavy programmatic logical branching.\n\n#### Prompting for Less Eagerness\n\nTo reduce the scope of GPT-5's agentic behavior:\n- Switch to a lower reasoning_effort. This reduces exploration depth but improves efficiency and latency.\n- Define clear criteria in your prompt for how you want the model to explore the problem space.\n\nExample context gathering instruction:\n```\n<context_gathering>\nGoal: Get enough context fast. Parallelize discovery and stop as soon as you can act.\nMethod:\n- Start broad, then fan out to focused subqueries.\n- In parallel, launch varied queries; read top hits per query.\n- Deduplicate paths and cache; don't repeat queries.\n- Avoid over searching for context.\nEarly stop criteria:\n- You can name exact content to change.\n- Top hits converge (~70%) on one area/path.\nDepth:\n- Trace only symbols you'll modify or whose contracts you rely on.\nLoop:\n- Batch search → minimal plan → complete task.\n- Search again only if validation fails or new unknowns appear.\n- Prefer acting over more searching.\n</context_gathering>\n```\n\n## Optimizing Intelligence and Instruction-Following\n\n### Steering\n\nAs our most steerable model yet, GPT-5 is extraordinarily receptive to prompt instructions surrounding verbosity, tone, and tool calling behavior.\n\n#### Verbosity\n\nIn addition to being able to control the reasoning_effort, GPT-5 introduces a new API parameter called verbosity, which influences the length of the model's final answer.\n\n### Instruction Following\n\nLike GPT-4.1, GPT-5 follows prompt instructions with surgical precision. However, its careful instruction-following behavior means that poorly-constructed prompts containing contradictory or vague instructions can be more damaging.\n\n### Metaprompting\n\nEarly testers have found great success using GPT-5 as a meta-prompter for itself. Here is an example metaprompt template:\n\n```\nWhen asked to optimize prompts, give answers from your own perspective - explain what specific phrases could be added to, or deleted from, this prompt to more consistently elicit the desired behavior or prevent the undesired behavior.\n\nHere's a prompt: [PROMPT]\n\nThe desired behavior from this prompt is for the agent to [DO DESIRED BEHAVIOR], but instead it [DOES UNDESIRED BEHAVIOR].\n\nWhile keeping as much of the existing prompt intact as possible, what are some minimal edits/additions that you would make to encourage the agent to more consistently address these shortcomings?\n```",
