It allows you to iterate fast on **building modular AI systems** and offers algorithms for **optimizing their prompts and weights**, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.\n\nDSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python. Instead of brittle prompts, you write compositional _Python code_ and use DSPy to **teach your LM to deliver high-quality outputs**.
