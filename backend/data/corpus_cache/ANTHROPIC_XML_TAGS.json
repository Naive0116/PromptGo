When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs. XML tip : Use tags like &lt;instructions&gt; , &lt;example&gt; , and &lt;formatting&gt; to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context. Why use XML tags? Clarity: Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured. Accuracy: Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt. Flexibility: Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything. Parseability: Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing. There are no canonical &quot;best&quot; XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround. Tagging best practices Be consistent : Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, Using the contract in &lt;contract&gt; tags... ). Nest tags : You should nest tags &lt;outer&gt;&lt;inner&gt;&lt;/inner&gt;&lt;/outer&gt; for hierarchical content. Power user tip : Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting ( &lt;examples&gt; ) or chain of thought ( &lt;thinking&gt; , &lt;answer&gt; ). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts. Examples Example: Generating financial reports Example: Legal contract analysis Prompt library Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.
